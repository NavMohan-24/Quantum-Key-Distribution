# Quantum-Key-Distribution
This is a collection of some assignments that I have done as a part of FDP program conducted by IIT Roorkee. Here I have tried implemention of 2 famous QKD protocol in Qiskit. The protocols i worked with are BB84 and B92. Also I have simulated the case of BB84 under eavesdropping.
